# COVID-19 Informational App

Curating a basic subset of useful information about COVID-19. Experimenting with changing the context that viewers recieve about the virus. My initial response to the [COVID-19 Global Cases app](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html) by John Hopkins was with surpise to my immediate feel that I was jumping into the real world version of [Plague, Inc](https://www.ndemiccreations.com/en/22-plague-inc). Mixed feelings are generated in the struggle between the gravity of life and death of the situation versus the building global anxiety and variety of responses to the future uncertainty.
